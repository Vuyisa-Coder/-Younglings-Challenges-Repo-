            <h1> About Me</h1>
            <p> I am Vuyisa Yengeni. I put my heart and soul in all that I do and I always make it a point that I get to the finish. I love sports, enjoy learning and doing new things and activities. With the tech space continuously evolving I am always looking forward to learning about new developments.</p>

            <hi>My Brand </hi>
            <P> I found fascination and passion in programming and so I took the first step and enrolled into CapaCiTi to equip myself and better my skills.At CapaCiTi I got a formal introduction into coding and this was to improve my technical skills and it has been a very challenging journey and yet an enjoyable one. 
                I have bveen intruduced to Python and also to one of its framework and database with which is Django and MySQL. I am looking to enhance my front-end developer skills and then I can look into the shifting my focus to the bacn-end side. Putting that together would make me a full stack Systems' developer. Once I master these languages I will then look into introducing myself to other languages to spread my skills and ailities in the software and system development field.
